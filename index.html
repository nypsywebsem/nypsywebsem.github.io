<h2>NYU Psychology Website Workshop</h2>
<hr>

<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Goal:</b> With minimal training in web programming (HTML/CSS), we plan to have everyone leave the workshop with a free, online, sharp website they can customize and update easily thereafter</li>
	<li><b>When?</b> Thursday, October 19th, 6 to 9 PM</li>
	<li><b>Where?</b> Meyer, Room 551 <i><br>*I am unsure if the listserv reached out to individuals without access, if so, please figure how you can obtain access as we will be unable to come sign people in</i></li>
	<li><b>Preparation:</b> Bring your laptop! That's it.</li>
	<li><b>Example websites with this exact method:</b><ul>
		<li>This page! Took about 30 minutes. (Don't worry, we'll have a few hours).</li>
		<li><a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~robs/index.html">Personal website example (i.e., stranger I found/stalked on google...)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/couples/">Lab site example (NYU Couples Lab, made by Qi Xu)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://nyuwow.org/index.html">Applied program site example (via Qi Xu)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://summer-mind.github.io/">Workshop/seminar etc. site example (Dartmouth MIND Summer School)</a></li></ul>

<h4>Workshop summary</h4>

	<p>We will be meeting on Thursday, October 19th, in Meyer 551 for a workshop for those interested in making their own free, beautifully designed website (for yourself, lab, etc.). This will be hands on, and I sincerely promise everyone who attends will have a solid website up and running by the end of the workshop, with knowledge necessary to further update and customize it thereafter. Intro and getting everyones site template up will only take an hour, and then we will stay in the room and help everyone build and edit their websites for a couple hours.
	<br><br>
	In only a couple hours, with the methods/templates we will use, your website can look like or unlike any one of the examples above, and many more, taken and highly customized from these templates from <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a>.
	<br><br>
	These websites will be free, beautifully designed, compatible across all browsers/devices, and require very little work on your end. I will also cover how to customize these easily (colors, text format, etc.). These may easily be moved to other host locations as well (eg, PIs/labs could likely get NYU to host), including your own purchased domain if you wish.</p>

<h4>Getting started</h4>
<ol>
	<li><b>Choose your design!</b> Pick a template from <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a> to work with. Or <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll</a> if you are interested in blogging. Or one from somewhere else! I personally recommend these templates for many reasons, such as ease, formatting, and importantly, compatibility across devices and browsers. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, which we will use to host our websites during the workshop for free, also offers templates.</li>
	<li><b>Get your site hosted and live!</b> Set up a github account, and page, by following the instructions on the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages home</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Upload and update as you go!</b> To upload your html pieces and update your github page, as you work on your local repository, use the following options:
	<ul>
		<li>Use command line to submit changes (if you are not using the Github GUI app for Windows or Mac):<br>
		<code>
		$ git add -A; git commit -am "update"; git push origin master
		</code>
		</li>
		<li>Use github's app or website interactively to upload and update files</li>
	</ul> </li>
</ol>

<h4>Other resources</h4>

Of course, you may decide to go your own way, using different hosting websites (such as your own domain: e.g., www.bob.com), different templates, interactive GUI website solutions, or you may want to learn to code on your own. Soon, I will compile a list of relevant resources here.
